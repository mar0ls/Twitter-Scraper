# Twitter-Scraper
created for training purposes


# Description
I present my version of Twitter scraper.
The snscrape libraries were used, which in my opinion work very well
in this role.

The user has two general search options to choose from. 
(Here you can use the advice from the help optionsor the following link to twitter-advance-search.)

in the first option you can use the application as a search engine for everything you need.
The second option is to search for user data by login.

The program saves data to the /results folder in two formats: .json and .cvs
which enables further analysis of the collected data.

The application returns data such as:
[+] tweet.id,
[+]tweet.content,
[+]tweet.media in the form of a url link,
[+]tweet.user.username of the author of the tweet,
[+]tweet.user.location,
[+]tweet.url,
[+]tweet.likeCount.

I encourage you to explore the full possibilities
advanced search on Twitter, which are described in detail
at the following link:
